## A brief introduction

Hi, folks. I go by the pseudonym "rass0x4f" on twitter and this is my personal website. Sometimes I post things, but more often I'm not (lol). I love talking about, experimenting in, and learning about a variety of topics including AI, cryptography and zero-knowledge, decentralized systems, cryptocurrencies and finance, and probably way too many others on unrelated fields. As of now, I'm currently deep in smart contract security and learning a lot of topics around it such as about blockchain, EVM, attack vectors, solidity, foundry/hardhat, flashloans, MEV, etc.
