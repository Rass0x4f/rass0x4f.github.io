## A brief introduction

Hi there, I go by the pseudonym "rass0x4f" on twitter and this is my personal website. Sometimes I post things, but more often I'm not (lol). I love talking about, experimenting in, and learning about a variety of topics, as of now are including AI, web development, decentralized systems, cryptocurrencies and finance, probably way too many others on unrelated fields.  


## AI

Quoting @nearcyan on his website: "AI is likely to have an absurdly huge impact on our species over the next few decades. After working in the field only briefly I decided Iâ€™d like to spend significantly more time in it, and also updated my timeline for when I think humanity will achieve AGI from my previous range of 40-100+ years to ~10-50 years (this is obviously pretty hard/impossible to predict, but I am definitely more bullish). Although I used to be on the fence on it, I now also think that AI alignment is probably the most important problem we can work on, and the largest existential risk, along with some feedback loops related to biology and bioengineering."
