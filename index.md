## Hi!

Heyo, I’m nearcyan and this is my (mostly outdated) personal website. Sometimes I post things about topics I’m interested in, but more often than that I do nothing. I love talking about, creating things in, and learning about a variety of topics including machine learning/AI, software engineering, web development, information security, digital privacy, decentralized systems, cryptocurrencies and finance, rationality and incentive structures, music and music theory, Japanese culture and anime, and probably way too many others. As of 2022 I now spend the vast majority of my time in VR and (occasionally longevity as well) and their applications to end-users as I believe this field will have, by far, the largest impact on the lives of others in the near-future.


## AI

AI is likely to have an absurdly large impact on our species over the next few decades. After working in the field only briefly I decided I’d like to spend significantly more time in it, and also updated my timeline for when I think humanity will achieve AGI from my previous range of 40-100+ years to ~10-50 years (this is obviously pretty hard/impossible to predict, but I am definitely more bullish). Although I used to be on the fence on it, I now also think that AI alignment is probably the most important problem we can work on, and the largest existential risk, along with some feedback loops related to biology and bioengineering.


## Contact

My DMs are open on just about any platform you can find me on, and I’d probably love to hear from you if you’re still reading this page. Feel free to chat with me about anything at all via Twitter, email (first letter of the English alphabet @ this domain),
